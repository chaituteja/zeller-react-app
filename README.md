# Zeller React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. All components are placed in `components` folder along with test files
2. Create `.env` file in the root directory and add `REACT_APP_API_KEY=<API_KEY>`. Please replace <API_KEY> with the actual API key provided to me.
